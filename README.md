# Socket.IO Template

Realized a lot of projects I've been working on lately use the same boiler plate setup for creating a backend Socket.IO server and a frontend that connects and emits connections.

Created this repository so that I could use a template for those projects instead of having to re-setup a new server and client for new projects.

React frontend, NodeJS backend Socket.IO server
## Usage

Client:

Created using create-react-app

`npm start`


Server:

Used `npm init`

`node index.js`
